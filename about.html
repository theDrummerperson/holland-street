<p>This website was built from scratch—no templates, no platforms, just pure code and design—through a journey of exploration powered by AI assistants, books, and conversations. It serves as a commentary on how we typically interact only with technology's inputs and outputs without understanding the inner workings. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and a reliance on technology without questioning its potential consequences. By recognizing the complexities and limitations of technology, we can become more discerning consumers and engage in a more informed and equitable use of technology.</p>
